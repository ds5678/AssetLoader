# AssetLoader

This is a library for modding **The Long Dark** by Hinterland Games Studio, Inc. It allows loading Unity assets from external asset bundles when using UnityEngine.Resources.Load and integrating additional Wwise SoundBanks.

> This library is only infrastructure for mods and does not provide any assets, asset bundles or SoundBanks and does not add or modify any items or game mechanics by itself.
